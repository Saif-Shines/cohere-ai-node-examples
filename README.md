# Purpose

This repository is an attempt to provide samples for the consuming cohere apis.

Along the way, I would wish to write a Friction log â€” A friction log is a document that captures a list of challenges, difficulties, or frustrations a developer might encounter using your product. It is a valuable tool for product managers and UX designers, as it can help them identify and address areas of the product that are causing users pain.
